    "Extract word pairs of rhymes in poems. Current for the collections of Shakespeare and Housman available in https://github.com/sravanareddy/rhymedata, courtesy of Sravana Reddy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Output format would be string tuples: \n",
    "**(word1 <str>, word2 <str>, rhyme pattern <str>, rhyme letter <str>, poetm title <str>, section id <str>,  author <str>)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">TITLE A Lover's Complaint\n",
    "\n",
    ">RHYME a b a b b c c\n",
    "\n",
    ">From off a hill whose concave womb reworded\n",
    "\n",
    ">A plaintful story from a sistering vale,\n",
    "\n",
    ">My spirits to attend this double voice reworded,\n",
    "\n",
    ">And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;\n",
    "\n",
    ">Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale, \n",
    "\n",
    ">Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,\n",
    "\n",
    ">Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "For the full scheme of the data, see: https://github.com/sravanareddy/rhymedata\n",
    "\n",
    "** Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*(reworded, reworded, ababbcc, a, A Lover's Complaint, 1, Shakespeare )*\n",
    "\n",
    "*(vale, tale, ababbcc, b, A Lover's Complaint, 1,  Shakespeare )*\n",

    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note1** For now, if a rhyme involves multiple words, like the **b** rhyem above, which as 3 words *vale*, *tale*, and *pale*. We extract all the pairs and keep the partial order, i.e.  *(vale, tale)*, *(tale, pale)* and *(vale, pale)* for the example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note2** a special scheme used in the original data is \n",
    "> Sometimes, we use a shorthand for the rhyme scheme, like \n",
    "\n",
    ">RHYME a a *\n",
    "\n",
    ">This denotes the rhyme scheme aabbccdd...\n",
    "\n",
    "We elaborate such patterns in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Note3** We may also want to keep a mapping from triple (poetm title <str>, section id <str>,  author <str>) to (section text, rhyme pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format of input data\n",
    "The format of original data is quite regular\n",
    "Each file dedicates to one author, which is specified in the first line\n",
    "\n",
    "**poem structure**:\n",
    ">an empty line\n",

    "Poem lines are consecutive lines with content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rhyme is at the last word of a poem line**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format of internal data\n",
    "\n",
    "**collections**: a list of **poem**, which is a tuple of (**poem title**, **list_of_section**)\n",
    "**list_of_section**: a list of **section**, each of which is a tuple (**section id**, **section text**, line_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two outputs \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **word_pair_list**: a list of word pairs, each of the format **(word1 <str>, word2 <str>, rhyme pattern <str>, rhyme letter <str>, poetm title <str>, section id <str>**  note, no author information is here, but can be easily inserted\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **section_map**: a dictionary. key: (poem title, section id)  value: tuple(section text, rhyme pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
